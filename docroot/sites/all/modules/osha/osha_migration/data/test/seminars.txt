EU-OSHA will contribute to meeting this need by providing information on the types of economic incentives that are most likely to succeed.</p><p>The objective of this workshop was to bring together high level international experts in the area of economic incentives in occupational safety and health (OSH) to discuss the first draft reports of the Agency project and give input and advice for the further development of the project. The published results of this workshop represent the current state of discussion in the course of the project. The final reports which have been validated by all member states are expected to be ready in the first half of 2010.The primary target audience of the project are financial institutions, such as insurance companies, and other organisations that can provide economic incentives to improve occupational safety and health (OSH). These organisations are regarded as important intermediaries to stimulate further efforts in OSH in their cooperating enterprises, e.g. as clients of insurances. Research has shown that external economic incentives can motivate further investments in prevention in all organisations and thus lead to lower accident rates.In an earlier forum publication the European Agency described several models (&ldquo;Effectiveness of economic incentives to improve occupational safety and health&rdquo; 2004), which are aimed to overcome the drawbacks of the classical insurance premium variations connected with the accident rate. Incentives based on historic performance alone will have only a limited impact on preventive work, the incentives should point forward instead, promoting more efforts, not only results.</p><p>EU-OSHA will build on the economic incentives information material on what member states currently do and develop a network of European organisations, which can provide economic incentives, to help promote the information material. In terms of its tasks, such network should (1) exchange research and good practice information on economic incentive models, (2) explore possibilities how to promote the use of incentive models in Europe, (3) give input and advise for Topic Centre products, and overall (4) promote the results of the project. Complementary to the network, the Topic Centre as a consortium of leading European OSH institutes is participating in the project and delivering the information material.</p>";"<p>Overall, there was a strong argument for the benefits of organisation-external economic benefits to improve occupational health and safety. This finding is tempered by methodological difficulties in evaluating the effectiveness of various incentive schemes, and it was suggested that further research is required to clarify ambiguous results that exist in the research literature. Insurance-related economic incentives are an effective way to motivate organisations to invest in OSH. Evidence suggests that economic incentives alter employees&rsquo; behaviour or incident rates in organisations.</p><p>The policy review reveals that examples of economic incentives exist in all EU Member States; few countries, however, appear to implement economic incentives as a macro-economic instrument to improve the quality of the working conditions. Every Member State applies economic incentives to stimulate compliance with OSH regulations in its own way, in line with its own political, economic and social contexts, and social insurance systems. Despite of the many differences in Europe, several country-clusters of similar approaches could be identified. Premium differentiation is mostly limited to experience rating depending on accident figures, but several promising approaches of more advanced premium variation systems have been developed. Tax incentive schemes are rare so far and exist only in Latvia, Netherlands, Germany and Sweden. Funding schemes are very common and exist in nearly all member states.Despite the relatively low use of economic incentives in Europe so far, the presented case studies of successful incentive schemes have demonstrated, that well designed incentives can have a considerable positive impact on OSH. The incentive scheme in the Finish agriculture lead to a decrease of accidents by over 10%, just for offering premium discounts for less occupational accidents to Finish farmers. In Italy a credit programme to financially support OSH investments in SMEs was quite successful by offering bank credits subsidised by the national Workers' Compensation Authority. In the German butchery sector a bonus-point system for the introduction of preventive activities has resulted in significantly better accident and health outcomes.All in all it can be concluded that experience rating based on accidents rates can be an effective measure to motivate improvements in OSH performance. Even better results, especially for SMEs, can be achieved by more future-oriented incentive schemes, which do reward not only the results of good OSH but also promote directly prevention efforts, such as investment in safer machinery and equipment, support of OSH training or the introduction of OSH management systems. The presented cases have shown, that economic incentives can be introduced in a cost-effective way with low administrative burden.The expert group agreed on action plans to continue its work in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Evaluation and methodology: Develop standards for the evaluation of economic incentive schemes</li><li>Practicalities: Exchange good practice for the practical implementation of economic incentive schemes, develop a simple and sector-independent incentives system as a starting point for interested organisations and countries</li><li>Political framework conditions: How to put economic incentives higher on the political agenda</li></ul>";"<p><strong>What can be done to increase the European collaboration regarding economic incentives to improve OSH?</strong></p><p>The results of both groups were clustered and the following main topics revealed:</p><p>Evaluation of economic incentives and methodology (insurance level, company level)</p><p>Practicalities of economic incentive schemes (learning from case studies, simple incentive schemes, focus on SMEs)</p><p>Political framework conditions (comparative analysis, needs of practitioners)</p><p>On the second day of the workshop, experts could choose one of the three topic fields for developing an action plan for the established network.
