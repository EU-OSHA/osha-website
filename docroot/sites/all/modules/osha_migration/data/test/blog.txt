Georgia is in the process of developing structures to improve workplace health and safety. An Association Agreement between Georgia and the European Union is being finalised, which includes a commitment from Georgia to bring its legislation in the field occupational safety and health into agreement with the EU Directives in the area. This is a good opportunity for EU-OSHA to provide support to Georgia as it develops its capacity to improve workplace health and safety.</p>";"<p>   As part of our visit, we also had the opportunity to discuss safety and health at work with representatives from the ILO as well as social partners, the Georgian Employers Association and the Georgian Trade Union Confederation. We were able to listen to the views of the Georgian social partners on safety and health at work and to discuss our future cooperation.</p>  <p>   Our meeting was informative and productive and we would like to thank our colleagues in Georgia for welcoming us to Tbilisi. We look forward to working together to help make the EU and Georgia safer, healthier and more productive places to work.</p>  <p>   For more information on the ENP: <a href=<@#&>http://eeas.europa.eu/enp/about-us/index_en.htm<@#&>>http://eeas.europa.eu/enp/about-us/index_en.htm</a></p>  <p>   Contact EU-OSHA on: information@osha.europa.eu</p>";"/en/about/director_corner/blog/european-neighbourhood-policy-project-in-georgia/georgian-architecture.JPG";"";"psychosocial_risks_and_stress, statistics, gender, legislation, research, fisheries, health_care, maintenance, healthcare, transport, publications";"XX";"";"06641B, 07401C";"01"
